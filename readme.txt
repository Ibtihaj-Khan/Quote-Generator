Hello! This is my Random Quote Generator Project, done as part of the FreeCodeCamp "Responsive Web Design" curriculum.

It is built pretty much entirely in the REACT framework, and it changes the quote/author/color randomly to a random quote from my set of Quotes in the code.

The tweet button will take you to the twitter tweet page (as specc'd in the project requirements), and facebook will just take you to the facebook home page (there was no requirement for the second button, but it looked better to balance the UI).

Since this is a React project, it was deployed to github pages, to visit, go here: https://ibtihaj-khan.github.io/Quote-Generator/

The source code is not on this Repo currently.
